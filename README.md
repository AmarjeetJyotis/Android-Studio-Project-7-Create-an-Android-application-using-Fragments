📱 Fragment Example App
This Android application demonstrates the use of Fragments to display different UI components in a side-by-side layout. It is a simple implementation that shows how multiple fragments can be managed in a single activity to organize content modularly.

🧾 Project Overview
The app consists of two fragments:

1st Fragment: Displays the user's name (AMARJEET KUMAR)

2nd Fragment: Displays the user's roll number (21BCS10768)

Each fragment has a unique background color to visually differentiate them. The fragments are displayed side by side in a landscape-style layout using a FrameLayout as their container.
