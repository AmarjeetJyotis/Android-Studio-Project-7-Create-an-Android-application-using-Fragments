# Fragment Example Android Application

This project is a demonstration of how to implement and manage multiple **Fragments** in an Android application. It showcases the use of `FrameLayout` containers to display two fragments side by side, making it ideal for learning about modular UI design in Android development.

## 📌 Project Summary

The application displays two fragments:
- **First Fragment**: Displays the user's full name (`AMARJEET KUMAR`)
- **Second Fragment**: Displays the user's roll number (`21BCS10768`)

Each fragment has a distinct background color and is aligned horizontally for clarity and separation of information.

## 🧱 Key Features

- Fragment creation and management
- Modular UI design using `FrameLayout`
- Responsive layout structure
- Clean separation of responsibilities across XML and Java classes
